# Get-Parked-Leonardo-s-Detection-Code
Made by: Get Parked

GitHub Repository for Leonardo's Open Spot Detection Code with main files, pictures, support files and tutorial presentation

This Repository will contain all the files and instructions needed to correctly set up an open spot detection system in a parking lot using Python, OpenCV and NumPy.

The purpose of this code is to detect open spots in a parking lot and along with a communication and display system developed by Get Parked it will gather data on open spots and transmit it to the Get Parked users. 

This code was developed regarding the following considerations:
  It will be ran from a device that contains a camera, most likely pointing to a parking lot.
  The position/angle of the camera will remain the same.
  The device chosen can run the code constantly.



In addition to these purposes, the main goal of this project is to apply and demonstrate the skills and knowledge learned during the Electrical Engineering Marine and Industrial Technology Diploma.
